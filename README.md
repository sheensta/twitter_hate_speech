# twitter_hate_speech

Implemented end to end Natural Language Processing project differentiating targeted hate speech from speech merely containing offensive words. From data cleaning, feature extraction (Bag of Words, nGrams, TF-IDF BOW, word2vec embedding), feature selection, and modeling. Used word2vec CBOW and Skip-gram for unsupervised learning. Also created multilayer perceptron for transfer learning and label propagation algorithm for semi-supervised learning.
